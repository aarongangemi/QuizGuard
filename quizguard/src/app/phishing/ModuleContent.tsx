      <h1>Understanding Phishing Scams and Prevention</h1>
      <Typography>
        Phishing is a cybercrime tactic where fraudulent emails, messages, or
        websites are used to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive
        information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data.
        These deceptive communications often impersonate trusted entities, such
        as banks, government agencies, or reputable companies, and typically
        employ social engineering techniques to manipulate victims into taking
        action.
